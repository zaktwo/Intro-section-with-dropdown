# This is the way i endup using to install Vite and deploy it to github action pages and versal 

    1 - installing node.js on my pc by downloading it from this link https://nodejs.org/en
    2 - using npm to install pnpm with command: npm install -g pnpm 
    3 - add pnpm path to envirement variables in system ->  about -> advanced system settings 
            -> envirement variables -> system variables -> path -> add C:\Users\~User~\AppData\Local\pnpm
    4 - Create a Project Folder
    5 - install Vite :
            pnpm create vite@latest ~Project~Name~ (to make a new folder, use dot . to create in the same folder)
    6 - Choise wich language to utilise for developemnt 
    7 - cd to the folder
    8 - pnpm install 
    9 - pnpm run dev
   10 - Create a vite.config.js file 
   11 - add this code: 
        import { defineConfig } from "vite";

        export default defineConfig({
             base: "/Intro-section-with-dropdown" // change the line according to your github repository
        })
   12 - go to github repository -> settings -> pages -> Source -> 
              Github actions -> static html
   13 - edit static.yml with this script:
# Use the script available in https://pnpm.io/continuous-integration

        with:
          # Upload dist repository
          path: .
      - name: Deploy

        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          publish_dir: ./public
          
    14 - This should be enough to deploy to github pages actions (if i didn't forgot something ) 
        Edit: this was not enough in the end. it installed correctly but didn't give me the deployement link
